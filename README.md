# FSLogin

ADFS &amp; Vulcan CUFS Login module

## Usage

#### Install the library dependency.

```gradle
repositories {
    jcenter()
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
dependencies {
    implementation 'eu.szkolny.fslogin:lib:<version>'
}
```

You can check the version on the GitHub releases page, or use `master-SNAPSHOT` for
the latest version (not recommended though, may be unstable).

#### Create a Realm.

You may obtain most of the supported login realms from the [FSLogin Realms](https://szkolny-eu.github.io/FSLogin/realms/) page.
The selected `realmData` may be used to create an appropriate Realm.

```kotlin
val realmData = RealmData() // pass the values here
val realm = realmData.toRealm()
```

You can deserialize the `realmData` JSON directly to an object, using e.g. Retrofit or Gson.

#### Log in

In order to get a certificate, create an instance of `FSLogin`.

```kotlin
val http = OkHttpClient.Builder()
                // you need to have a working cookie jar
                .cookieJar(MyCookieJar())
                // to support most of the realms, as some are using insecure TLS
                .connectionSpecs(listOf(ConnectionSpec.COMPATIBLE_TLS))
                .build()
val fsLogin = FSLogin(http, debug = true)
```

Then just call `fsLogin.performLogin(realm, username, password, onSuccess, onFailure)`:

```kotlin
fsLogin.performLogin(
    realm = CufsRealm(host = "fakelog.cf", symbol = "powiatwulkanowy"),
    username = "jan@fakelog.cf",
    password = "jan123",
    onSuccess = { certificate -> 

    },
    onFailure = { errorText ->

    }
)
```

#### Final step

A certificate retrieved in `onSuccess` may be `POST`ed to `realm.getFinalRealm()` to complete the login process:

```kotlin
// returns an HTML body of the website
val result = fsLogin.api.postCertificate(certificate.formAction, mapOf(
    "wa" to certificate.wa,
    "wresult" to certificate.wresult,
    "wctx" to certificate.wctx
)).execute().body()
```

You can use a custom method for posting those form fields.
